"""The Conker module contract, asserted against a running module.

This file is identical in every module except SERVICE and DEFAULT_URL. A
convention nobody checks decays into a convention nobody follows, and the point
of the contract is that one dashboard renders any module with no special cases -
so the shape is verified rather than trusted.

It talks HTTP to a running service on purpose. The contract is an HTTP contract,
so asserting it in-process would check a Python object while the thing that
ships is a container - and it would inherit whatever global state earlier tests
left behind, which is exactly how the first version of this file broke.

    docker compose up -d && pytest tests/test_module_contract.py

Skips when nothing is listening. CI brings the stack up first.
Contract: docs/module-contract.md in the conker repository.
