# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Persist stable tool/workflow dispatch identities before execution; atomically consume approval and reserve paid cost. Replays return recorded status; ambiguous interruptions hold without redispatch.
- Add owner-only cumulative/per-job microUSD caps and immutable job/reservation accounting. Bound Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite requests and reconcile known usage; disable unaccounted paid routes.
- Add action/job fields to HTTP, CLI and MCP and agent-specific status lookup. See `docs/DURABLE_EXECUTION_AND_SPENDING.md` for required caller changes and unsupported routes.

Versions are the module's own, not the API revision — the two mean different
things, and a dashboard reading one field for both is wrong about every module
it does not special-case. A change to the shape of `/health` or any endpoint is
a contract change and gets its own entry.

## Unreleased

- Reject CGNAT/Tailscale and metadata destinations in public HTTPS research,
  HTTP tools and public service-health probes. Validate all DNS answers at
  connection time, pin the socket to a validated IP and disable environment
  proxies. Preserve TLS hostname verification and check every research redirect.

- Close forged verification creation through both generic request endpoints. Only
  invocation can issue a verification, with immutable issuance provenance.
- Cancel old unconsumed verifications on upgrade; their origin cannot be trusted.
  Preserve history and require fresh confirmation. Check provenance again at
  decision and consumption, including before startup migration has run.
- Serialize request decisions with consumption and disallow generic request
  replacement. Creation, decision and consumption commit their audit events in
  the same transaction. Expired approvals and callback races return conflicts.
- Bootstrap is insert-only, defaults to no scopes, and preserves narrowed/revoked
  keys. Editing scopes no longer reactivates a revoked key; mint a new key instead.
- Extend the mutation drill to ten cases, including forged approvals, a stale
  decision resurrecting consumption, and bootstrap restoring authority.


- Remove `/v2/ai/*`, the AI Builder, planner, automatic AI-draft promotion and
  MCP MemoryGate skill injection. Pi owns cognition.
- Archive retained AI sessions/proposals and related events transactionally in
  `v2_ai_archive`; preserve original rows and IDs. Owner-only `/v2/archives/ai`
  exports a versioned handoff. Pi import is still required separately.
- Move deterministic research adapters to `toolgate/executors/research.py`;
  existing tool IDs and executor contracts continue to work.
- Replace the unscoped in-process MCP console with an opt-in authenticated HTTP
  bridge. No vault access, admin fallback, redirect following or automatic retry.
  Tool calls now nest inputs under `args`; normalized names have stable suffixes.
- Rename `planner_model`/`planner_url` settings to `generation_model`/
  `generation_url`, preserving configured values on upgrade for atomic Ollama
  tools. `/health` keeps its envelope; its optional `planner` check is replaced
  by `generation`, independent of MemoryGate credentials.

## 0.2.2

Secrets no longer ship inside the image.

- **The image carried a real `.env` and a working database.** `COPY toolgate
  ./toolgate` sweeps the whole package directory, and ToolGate keeps its data
  *inside* that directory - so every build baked in the admin key, the vault
  salt, the MemoryGate read key, a GitHub token, a Tavily key, and an 86KB
  `toolgate.db` of encrypted secrets and audit history. Published that way in
  0.2.0 and 0.2.1, which are being deleted from the registry; the credentials
  are being rotated. The gitignore was correct throughout - Docker's `COPY`
  simply does not read it.
- **`.dockerignore`, with every pattern anchored `**/`.** The first attempt
  used a bare `.env`, which matches only the root of the build context. The
  file that leaked was one level down, so the build looked fixed and leaked
  exactly as before.
- **CI builds the image and searches it**, rather than trusting the ignore
  file still matches after someone moves a path. Scoped to `/app`: a
  filesystem-wide hunt for `*.pem` matches the OS certificate store, and a
  check that cries wolf is a check somebody turns off.
- **`/health` reported `0.2.0` while the module shipped as v0.2.1.** Fixed.
  Same class of defect as the leak: the code saying something untrue about
  itself.

## 0.2.1

Publish workflow only: attestation is skipped while the repository is private,
so a successful image push is no longer reported as a failure.

## 0.2.0

**The vault stored provider credentials in plaintext.** "Write-only" is a
property of the HTTP surface — no route returns a value — but that says nothing
about the file, and anyone with file access read every key. Values are now
Fernet tokens behind an `enc:v1:` prefix, with the key derived by scrypt from an
install-time secret held deliberately *outside* the values file: either
`TOOLGATE_VAULT_SECRET`, or a `0600` key file on its own volume, so copying the
data directory does not carry the key that decrypts it. The scrypt salt sits
beside the values because a salt is not a secret and keeping it there is what
lets a passphrase survive a restart. `encrypt_values_at_rest()` migrates an
existing plaintext file.

**`/health` probed nothing** and returned a fixed answer, so a dependency could
be gone while health said otherwise. It now probes the control plane database,
the vault, searxng, MemoryGate and the planner, reporting `degraded` naming what
failed. It distinguishes `not_configured` from `unavailable`, because "nothing
here yet" and "it broke" are different facts and collapsing them is how a
dashboard starts lying. Answers are cached with their age, since the route is
unauthenticated.

**`/health` now answers in the shared module contract shape** — adding `service`
and changing `version` from the API revision `"v2"` to this module's own version.

**The stdio MCP bridge is renamed and described honestly.** Behaviour is
unchanged: it reads no execution key, never calls `is_scoped`, and attributes
everything to one hardcoded actor. It is now the single-operator console bridge
and says so in its first paragraph, alongside what still applies — lockdown,
validation, approval binding, limits and audit. Agents use the keyed HTTP API,
which enforces the identity and scope this cannot. See
`docs/SINGLE_OPERATOR_MCP_BRIDGE.md`.

Also fixes a pre-existing test failure on Windows, where runtime paths were
compared as strings across a platform separator difference.

## 0.1.0

First release. Services, tools, automations and requests; per-tool policy;
rotatable scoped execution keys; approvals bound to an exact object, version,
argument digest, nonce and expiry, consumed once; signed verification callbacks;
lockdown mode; redacted audit trail; stdio MCP bridge.
